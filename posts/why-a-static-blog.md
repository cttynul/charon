In a web where complexity seems to be the norm, Charon goes against the grain. But why choose a static architecture? There are several key advantages that guided this decision.

### Speed and Performance

A static site doesn't need to query a database or execute server-side code every time a page is requested. The HTML files, once generated, are ready to be served directly. This results in:
* **Near-instant loading times**: A better user experience and a more favorable ranking on search engines.
* **Lower resource usage**: Your site can be hosted on a lightweight, inexpensive hosting service.

### Security

Without a database and a complex backend, the attack surface is drastically reduced. There's no risk of SQL injections or other common vulnerabilities found in dynamic systems. Charon is inherently more secure.

### Simple Management

Managing a blog with Charon is as simple as writing in a text editor. There's no need for a complex admin panel. Just write a Markdown file, run the synchronization script, and you're all set.

### Markdown File Example

Here's an example of how a Markdown file is structured, including headings, lists, and tables.

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
| :--- | :--- |
| Heading 1 | `# Heading 1` |
| Heading 2 | `## Heading 2` |
| Unordered List | `- Item 1` |
| Ordered List | `1. First item` |
| Bold Text | `**Bold text**` |

```python
print("Hello Charon!")
```

Charon is a testament to the fact that sometimes, the simplest solution is also the best one.
