It all started with a simple idea: to create a blog without the complex overhead of a database or a backend. I wanted a system that was fast, secure, and incredibly easy to manage. The solution? A static blog!

Most existing blogging systems require servers, databases, and constant maintenance. But if your only goal is to share thoughts, articles, and projects, is all of that truly necessary?

### The Power of Markdown and JavaScript

The answer was a resounding "no." I realized I could harness the power of **Markdown** for writing content and use a bit of **JavaScript** to load and render everything. The approach was simple:
1.  Write content in `.md` files, which are easy to read and edit.
2.  Use a hash-based router (`#/`) to navigate between pages without full reloads.
3.  Load the `.md` files dynamically and convert them into HTML.

### A Comparison with Traditional CMS

To better understand the benefits, let's look at a direct comparison between Charon and a typical dynamic CMS.

| Feature | Charon (Static) | Dynamic CMS (e.g., WordPress) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Speed** | Very high (pre-generated HTML) | Varies (requires database queries) |
| **Security** | Inherently high | Vulnerable to SQL injections, etc. |
| **Maintenance** | Almost none | Core, plugin, and theme updates |
| **Scalability** | Easy and inexpensive | Requires complex infrastructure |

### The Result

Today, Charon is a framework that does exactly what I need it to do: it lets me focus on writing, while it takes care of everything else.
