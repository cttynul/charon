## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Getting started is painless.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js installed on your machine to use the sync.js script.

1. Set Up Your Site
Start by configuring your blog in js/site.js.

```
module.exports = {
    siteName: "My Awesome Blog",
    footerText: "Â© 2024 My Awesome Blog. All rights reserved.",
    postsPath: "posts",
    pagesPath: "pages",
    imagesPath: "images",
    logoNavbarPath: "images/logo.png",
    logoMainPath: null,
    faviconPath: "images/favicon.ico",
    viewMode: "grid" // "grid" or "list"
};
```

2. Create your contents
Just drop your Markdown files into the posts/ or pages/ folders. Don't worry about editing data/post.js or data/pages.jsâ€”we have a guy for that.

3. Automagic
Run the synchronization script from your terminal.

```
node sync.js
```

This command will:

- Scan the posts/ and pages/ directories.
- Automatically update data/post.js and data/pages.js with new entries.
- Create a dedicated image folder for each new post.

4. Serve and Enjoy
Simply open index.html in your favorite web browser. For local development, a simple web server (like live-server or Python's built-in server) is recommended.

### ðŸŽ¨ Customization

- Global Settings: Edit `js/site.js` to change the site name, footer, logos, and layout mode ("grid" or "list").

- Custom CSS: Override any default styles by adding your own rules to `css/custom.css`.
